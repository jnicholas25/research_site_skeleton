To run the website, Go into research_site/ and run `index.html`, this is the index file which opens up to the Home Page, the website can be navigated from here and has all the data mentioned in the `Format research data module content`, `Home Page`, and `Realistic Research module content` as provided by Prof. Roback.

If I had more time, I would develop the color scheme with tokens for background, text, and accents. In terms of web development, I would add skip links, tighten ARIA (landmarks, `aria-current`). Using a mobile menu and a 4/8 spacing system, I would increase responsive behavior. Additionally, I would include meta/OG tags, a sitemap, and optimize performance (minified CSS, reconnects, media `loading="lazy"). Lastly, I would break up repetitive UI elements into small, reusable parts.
